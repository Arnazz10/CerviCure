🔍 What is Cervical Cancer?
Cervical cancer starts in the cells of the cervix — the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It typically develops over time and can be detected early through regular screening tests. If left untreated, it can spread to other parts of the body, becoming life-threatening.

👩‍⚕️ Causes of Cervical Cancer
The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 🦠, a sexually transmitted infection, is the leading cause of cervical cancer. While HPV is common and usually harmless, certain strains can cause abnormal cell growth in the cervix, which may develop into cancer over time.

Other factors include:

- Smoking 🚬
- Weakened immune system 🦠
- Long-term use of birth control pills 💊
- Multiple pregnancies 🤰
- Early sexual activity and multiple partners

🛡️ Prevention
The good news is that cervical cancer is largely preventable through early detection and vaccination 💉.

📋 Key Prevention Strategies:
- HPV Vaccination 💉: Administered to pre-teens and young adults to protect against the virus.
- Regular Pap Smear Tests 🧫: A screening procedure to detect abnormal cells in the cervix.
- HPV Testing 🧬: Checks for the presence of the virus in the cervix.
- Safe Sexual Practices ❤️: Use condoms and limit the number of sexual partners to reduce HPV risk.
  
🚨 Symptoms to Watch Out For
Cervical cancer in its early stages may not present any obvious symptoms 🕵️‍♀️. However, as the disease progresses, symptoms may include:

- Abnormal vaginal bleeding 🩸 (e.g., between periods or after menopause)
- Pain during intercourse 😣
- Unusual vaginal discharge 💧
- Pelvic pain
